# Swipe Functionality for Car Cards

## Overview
The car cards in the Home screen now support horizontal swiping gestures to save or remove cars from the user's garage.

## How It Works

### Swipe Right (→) - Save Car
- Swipe the car card to the right to save it to your garage
- The car will be added to the Garage screen
- Visual feedback shows "SAVED" with a green overlay
- Card animates off-screen and transitions to the next car

### Swipe Left (←) - Remove Car
- Swipe the car card to the left to remove/reject it
- The car will not be saved to your garage
- Visual feedback shows "REMOVED" with a red overlay
- Card animates off-screen and transitions to the next car

### Partial Swipe
- If you don't swipe far enough (less than 100px), the card will snap back to center
- This allows users to change their mind or get a better look at the car

## Visual Feedback

### During Swipe
- Card opacity changes to indicate swipe progress
- Scale effect provides depth perception
- Smooth horizontal movement

### Swipe Indicators
- **Right side**: Green "SAVE" indicator appears when swiping right
- **Left side**: Red "REMOVE" indicator appears when swiping left
- **Center overlay**: Large text shows "SAVED" or "REMOVE" when threshold is reached

### Swipe Hint
- Text below the card shows "Swipe right to save • Swipe left to remove"
- Helps new users understand the gesture controls

## Technical Implementation

### Gesture Handling
- Uses `react-native-gesture-handler` for smooth gesture recognition
- Pan gesture handler detects horizontal swipes
- Threshold of 100px determines if swipe is complete

### Animation
- Smooth spring animations for natural card movement
- Cards animate off-screen in the swipe direction
- Automatic transition to next card after swipe completion

### State Management
- Uses React Context (`CarContext`) to manage saved cars
- Saved cars are automatically added to the Garage screen
- State persists across app navigation

## User Experience

### Intuitive Controls
- Natural left/right swipe gestures
- Clear visual feedback for each action
- Smooth animations enhance the experience

### Accessibility
- Cards remain accessible during swipes
- Visual indicators help users understand actions
- Gesture thresholds prevent accidental actions

### Performance
- Optimized animations using native driver where possible
- Efficient state updates for smooth transitions
- Minimal re-renders during swipe interactions

## Debugging Process

### Issue Resolution
The initial implementation had render errors that were resolved through a systematic debugging approach:

1. **Simplified Version**: Started with a basic HomeScreen without animations
2. **Gradual Feature Addition**: Added gesture handling, then visual effects, then indicators
3. **Type Safety**: Used TypeScript compilation checks to identify issues
4. **Style Validation**: Ensured all referenced styles were properly defined

### Key Fixes Applied
- Removed unused imports and variables
- Fixed animated text interpolation issues
- Added missing style definitions
- Simplified complex animation chains
- Used proper type assertions for animated values

### Current Status
✅ **Fully Functional**: Swipe functionality is working without render errors
✅ **Type Safe**: No TypeScript compilation errors
✅ **Performance Optimized**: Smooth animations and efficient state management
✅ **User Friendly**: Clear visual feedback and intuitive gestures
